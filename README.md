# My Personal Site

I wanted to create this site using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The UI/UX is not intuitive on purpose, I was inspired by the brutalist web designs found here:
https://brutalistwebsites.com/

This site is currently still in work, I need to:
- fix the mobile views for several pages
- consolidate repeated code from several pages into one source

This site is currently live @ www.zaledavis.com
